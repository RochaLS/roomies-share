# 🏠 Roomies Pay  
**Split expenses with your roommates — fast, fair, and frustration-free.**

Roomies Pay is a full-stack web app that helps roommates track shared expenses, split bills, and settle balances with zero drama.  
Add expenses, split them automatically, track who owes who, and keep everyone on the same page.


## ⭐ About Roomies Pay  
Living with roommates can be great — until it's time to split rent, utilities, groceries, or random shared purchases.  
Roomies Pay makes the process simple and transparent:

- Add shared expenses  
- Track each roommate’s balance  
- See who owes who  

No more awkward conversations, spreadsheets, or mental math.


## 🎯 Why I Built This  
I’ve lived with roommates and know how messy expense-sharing can get.  
Most apps that do this are either too complex or locked behind paywalls.  
I wanted something:

- Clean  
- Fast  
- Easy to use  
- Shared between multiple people  
- And actually enjoyable to use

Roomies Pay solves the everyday roommate headache of “who owes what?” with a simple interface and intuitive logic.
